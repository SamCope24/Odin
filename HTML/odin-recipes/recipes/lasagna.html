    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>Lasagne are a type of pasta, possibly one of the oldest types, made of very wide, flat sheets. Either term can
        also refer to an Italian dish made of stacked layers of lasagne alternating with fillings such as rag√π (ground
        meats and
        tomato sauce), vegetables, cheeses (which may include ricotta, mozzarella, and parmesan), and seasonings and
        spices, like Italian seasoning, such as garlic, oregano and basil. </p>

    <p>The dish may be topped with grated cheese, which becomes melted after baking. Typically, cooked pasta is
        assembled with the other ingredients and then baked in an oven. The resulting casserole is cut into
        single-serving square portions.</p>
